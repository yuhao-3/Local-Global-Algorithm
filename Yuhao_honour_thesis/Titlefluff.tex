Bayesian Paradigm

Variational Approximation: as a deterministic approximation algorithm for Approximate Bayesian Inference(ABI) of intractable posterior distribution, has been applied prevalently for fast Approximate Bayesian Inference(ABI) among the Bayesian Statistical community, while it is also a faster alternative to Monte Carlo methods such as Markov Chain and Monte Carlo(MCMC).
The main idea behind Variational Approximation is: given an assumed distribution set, it will search for an optimal posterior distribution by continuing minimizing the gap between true posterior and estimated posterior such as using Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence(KL-divergence) as a distance metric.

Nevertheless, elegant property in MCMC such as obatining exact posterior if infinite burn-in time period is assigned, doesn't occur in Variational Inference, which means the approximation accuracy will be a pivotal concern as  unsatisfied distribution such as underestimating the variance when the correlation of variables becomes large. 

In this thesis, we will firstly introduce lasso distribution, which could be matched for facilitating local parameter estimate, followed by the introduction of two fast and more accurate Variational Approximation algorithms and apply them in the Bayesian Lasso regression problem. The main idea behind these methods involves using the information of local parameter estimates by accommodating the univariate and multivariate lasso distribution, which results in more accurate global parameter approximation through Gaussian Variational Approximation. 
The first method involves matching with marginal univariate lasso distribution by updating global parameter for each variable per iteration. Additionally, we propose another algorithm for matching a local bivariate lasso distribution for updating global parameter for each pair of variables per iteration, successfully addressing the issue when initial diagonal covariance occurs.

To verify the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm, numerous experiments would be conducted under real-world datasets such as Hitter Dataset using several evaluation metric such as $l_1$ accuracy and matrix norm.
Our result suggest their high Variational Approximation accuracy with a descent time efficiency, compared with the traditional Monte Carlo methods and Mean-Field Variational Bayes(MFVB).
