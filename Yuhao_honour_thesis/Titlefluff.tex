Lasso penalized regression is a popular technique for simultaneous coefficient estimation and variable selection. Issues associated with this method include potential sensitivity of estimation and variable selection to the choice of tuning parameter, and calculating appropriate standard errors of the estimates. This project will adopt a Bayesian approach and develop various fast Approximate Bayesian Inference (ABI) methods for this problem. ABI methods include Gaussian Variational Approximate inference, Moment Propagation, Approximate Posterior Statistic Matching, and Population Based Variational Bayes (time permitting). A variety of model representations will also be considered. We compare these to much slower MCMC and frequentist methods to assess the accuracy of standard error estimates for ABI methods, as well as model selection accuracy.

   Finally, I would like to thank my friends   my family: my mother, father, brother, grandparents, and cousins. The last couple years has been full of adversity and I could not have overcome it without your support behind the scenes.
