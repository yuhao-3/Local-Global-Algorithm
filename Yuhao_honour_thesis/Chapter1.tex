Variational Approximation: an optimimization based technique for approximate bayesian inference, obtain interval estimate and error variance.
A class of techniques which try to approximate the itnractable posterior distribution with a tractable distribuition. Generally the paraemters of tracatble approximation are chosen to minimize some measure of its distance from the true posterior(KL-divergence)


Bayesian Lasso Problem





\section{Contribution}
Our main contribution could be concluded as the following part:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Design of a new posterior parameter correction approach based on the posterior estimate of Mean-Field Variation Bayes parameter 
\end{itemize}



\section{Thesis Organization}
This paper will be divided up into 6 chapters. Chapter 1 will briefly illustrate the motivation and application of variational approximation. Section 2 will briefly introduce basic definition and methodlogy in previous work such as MCMC(Monte Carlo Method) and Mean-Field Variational Bayes(MFVB). We will present our main methodlogy of variational correction algorithm in Chapter 3, followed by a comprehensive experiment for testing the effectiveness of algorithm in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, we will briefly discuss and explain our result and potential improvement in the future.
